## Project Description

The objective of this project is to create a single-page application that fetches data from a mock API endpoint and displays it in a visually appealing and interactive dashboard.

## Features

### Data Fetching and Display

- **Data Fetching:** Fetch data from the mock API endpoint.
- **Charts:** Visualize data using charts to show trends and patterns.

### User Interface

- **Clean Design:** Create a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various devices.
- **Styling:** Use CSS to style the application, ensuring it is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

### Interactivity

- **Filters:** Implement filters to allow users to refine the data displayed.
- **Tooltips:** Provide tooltips to give additional context and information on data points.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
